# A CNN to detect LFEs in Parkfield
1. You need to make a new conda environment and install tensorflow, obspy, and pandas into it.
2. This repo contains a number of different trained models to detect LFEs in Parkfield.  You can run the apply_cnn.py script to make detections on a single day of data and write them to a pickle file.
